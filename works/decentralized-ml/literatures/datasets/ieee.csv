The FL progresses learning locally on each device and gradually improves the learning model through interaction with the central server. However, it can cause network overload because of limited communication bandwidth and the participation of a huge number of users. One of the ways to minimize the network load is for the model to converge rapidly and stably with target learning accuracy. In this paper, we propose blockchain based federated learning scenario. Blockchain can efficiently induce users to participate in learning and can separate each participating user as a `node'. In addition, it can be pursued the integrity, stability, and so on. We consider two types of weights to choose the subset of clients for updating the global model. First, we consider the weight based on local learning accuracy of each client. Second, we consider the weight based on participation frequency of each client. We choose two key performance indicators, learning speed and standard deviation, to compare the performance of our proposed scheme with existing schemes. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves higher stability along with fast convergence time for targeted accuracy compared to others.","2576-8565","978-4-88552-320-5","10.23919/APNOMS.2019.8893114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8893114","Federated Learning;Blockchain;Node Selection;Weighting scheme","","cryptography;distributed databases;learning (artificial intelligence)","blockchain-based node-aware dynamic weighting methods;decentralized learning method;FL progresses learning;learning model;central server;network overload;network load;blockchain based federated learning scenario;global model;local learning accuracy;participation frequency;key performance indicators;federated learning performance","","2","7","","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To help manufacturers develop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system leveraging a reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to train a machine learning model based on customers’ data. Then, manufacturers can predict customers’ requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are untampered, malicious customers or manufacturers’ activities are traceable. In the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers’ privacy and improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy on the extracted features and propose a new normalization technique. We experimentally demonstrate that our normalization technique outperforms batch normalization when features are under differential privacy protection. In addition, to attract more customers to participate in the crowdsourcing FL task, we design an incentive mechanism to award participants.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3017377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9170559","Blockchain;Crowdsourcing;Differential privacy;Federated learning;IoT;Mobile edge computing.","","","","","","","","18 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Each examination can help in the diagnosis or prediction of further disease progression. Furthermore, all produced data from these examinations must be stored somewhere and available to various medical practitioners for analysis who may be in geographically diverse locations. The current medical climate leans towards remote patient monitoring and AI-assisted diagnosis. To make this possible, medical data should ideally be secured and made accessible to many medical practitioners, which makes them prone to malicious entities. Medical information has inherent value to malicious entities due to its privacy-sensitive nature in a variety of ways. Furthermore, if access to data is distributively made available to AI algorithms (particularly neural networks) for further analysis/diagnosis, the danger to the data may increase (e.g., model poisoning with fake data introduction).

Furthermore, although blockchain-enabled FL has been proposed to give workers reward, any rigorous reward policy design has not been discussed. In this paper, to tackle these issues, we present a novel method using mechanism design, which is an economic approach to realize desired objectives under the situation that participants act rationally. The key idea is to introduce repeated competition for FL so that any rational worker follows the protocol and maximize their profits. With mechanism design, we propose a generic full-fledged protocol design for FL on a public blockchain.

In an open network of participating nodes, the threat of adversarial nodes introducing poisoned models into the network increases compared to a federated learning scenario which is controlled by a single authority.

Such misbehavior are not auditable and parameter server may compute incorrectly due to single point failure. Furthermore, FL has no incentive to attract sufficient distributed training data and computation power. In this paper, we propose FLChain to build a decentralized, public auditable and healthy FL ecosystem with trust and incentive. FLChain replace traditional FL parameter server whose computation result must be consensual on-chain. Our work is not trivial when it is vital and hard to provide enough incentive and deterrence to distributed trainers. We achieve model commercialization by providing a healthy marketplace for collaborative-training models. Honest trainer can gain fairly partitioned profit from well-trained model according to its contribution and the malicious can be timely detected and heavily punished.

This has resulted in a quality over quantity issue in data science where a lot of data is being generated, but the majority of it is irrelevant. Furthermore, most of the data and the resources needed to effectively train machine learning models are owned by major tech companies, resulting in a centralization problem. As such, federated learning seeks to transform how machine learning models are trained by adopting a distributed machine learning approach. Another promising technology is the blockchain, whose immutable nature ensures data integrity.

Tapping into this unlimited reservoir of information presents the problem of finding quality data out of a myriad of irrelevant ones, which to this day, has been a significant issue in data science with a direct ramification of this being the inability to generate quality ML models for useful predictive analysis. Edge computing has been deemed a solution to some of issues such as privacy, security, data silos and latency, as it ventures to bring cloud computing services closer to end-nodes. A new form of edge computing known as edge-AI attempts to bring ML, AI, and predictive analytics services closer to the data source (end devices). In this paper, we investigate an approach to bring edge-AI to end-nodes through a shared machine learning model powered by the blockchain technology and a federated learning framework called iFLBC edge. Our approach addresses the issue of the scarcity of relevant data by devising a mechanism known as the Proof of Common Interest (PoCI) to sieve out relevant data from irrelevant ones. The relevant data is trained on a model, which is then aggregated along with other models to generate a shared model that is stored on the blockchain. The aggregated model is downloaded by members of the network which they can utilize for the provision of edge intelligence to end-users. This way, AI can be more ubiquitous as members of the iFLBC network can provide intelligence services to end-users.","","978-1-7281-6873-9","10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS49724.2020.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123014","","","cloud computing;cryptography;distributed databases;learning (artificial intelligence)","edge-AI;iFLBC edge;edge intelligence;deep learning;Internet of Things devices;predictive analysis;edge computing;federated learning blockchain network;artificial intelligence;machine learning;Proof of Common Interest;cloud computing services","","","20","","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A central aggregator updates a global model by collecting local updates from mobile devices using their local training data to train the global model in each iteration. However, unreliable data may be uploaded by the mobile devices (i.e., workers), leading to frauds in tasks of federated learning. The workers may perform unreliable updates intentionally, for example, the data poisoning attack, or unintentionally, for example, low-quality data caused by energy constraints or high-speed mobility. Therefore, finding out trusted and reliable workers in federated learning tasks becomes critical. In this article, the concept of reputation is introduced as a metric.

Recently, privacy-preserving deep learning has drawn tremendous attention from information security community, in which neither training data nor the training model is expected to be exposed. Federated learning is a popular learning mechanism, where multiple parties upload local gradients to a server and the server updates model parameters with the collected gradients. However, there are many security problems neglected in federated learning, for example, the participants may behave incorrectly in gradient collecting or parameter updating, and the server may be malicious as well. In this paper, we present a distributed, secure, and fair deep learning framework named \textit{DeepChain} to solve these problems. DeepChain provides a value-driven incentive mechanism based on Blockchain to force the participants to behave correctly. Meanwhile, DeepChain guarantees data privacy for each participant and provides auditability for the whole training process. We implement a DeepChain prototype and conduct experiments on a real dataset for different settings, and the results show that our DeepChain is promising.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2019.2952332","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Guangdong Provincial Special Funds for Applied Technology Research and Development and Transformation of Important Scientific and Technological Achieve; National Key RD Program of China; National Key RD Plan of China; Guangdong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center on Network Security Detection and Defence; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8894364","Deep learning;Privacy-preserving training;Blockchain;Incentive","Deep learning;Training;Servers;Blockchain;Collaboration;Training data;Data models","","","","9","","","8 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This article introduces a framework named PriModChain that enforces privacy and trustworthiness on IIoT data by amalgamating differential privacy, federated ML, Ethereum blockchain, and smart contracts. The feasibility of PriModChain in terms of privacy, security, reliability, safety, and resilience is evaluated using simulations developed in Python with socket programming on a general-purpose computer.

In the big data era, one of the most critical applications is multiparty learning or federated learning, which allows different parties to collaborate with each other to obtain better learning models without sharing their own data. However, there are several main concerns about the current multiparty learning systems. First, most existing systems are distributed and need a central server to coordinate the learning process. However, such a central server can easily become a single point of failure and may not be trustworthy. Second, although quite a few schemes have been proposed to study Byzantine attacks, a very common and challenging kind of attack in distributed systems, they generally consider the scenario of learning a global model. However, in fact, all parties in multiparty learning usually have their own local models. The learning methods and security issues in this case are not fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-empowered decentralized secure multiparty learning system with heterogeneous local models called BEMA. Particularly, we consider two types of Byzantine attacks, and carefully design “off-chain sample mining” and “on-chain mining” schemes to protect the security of the proposed system. We theoretically prove the system performance bound and resilience under Byzantine attacks. Simulation results show that the proposed system obtains comparable performance with that of conventional distributed systems, and bounded performance in the case of Byzantine attacks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2987843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066954","Multiparty learning;security;blockchain;decentralized network;heterogeneous models.","Computational modeling;Calibration;Learning systems;Predictive models;Servers;Data models","","","","","","","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In FL, the central aggregator accumulates local updates uploaded by participants to update a global model. However, there are two critical security threats: poisoning and membership inference attacks. These attacks may be carried out by malicious or unreliable participants, resulting in the construction failure of global models or privacy leakage of FL models. Therefore, it is crucial for FL to develop security means of defense. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based secure FL framework to create smart contracts and prevent malicious or unreliable participants from being involved in FL. In doing so, the central aggregator recognizes malicious and unreliable participants by automatically executing smart contracts to defend against poisoning attacks. Further, we use local differential privacy techniques to prevent membership inference attacks. Numerical results suggest that the proposed framework can effectively deter poisoning and membership inference attacks, thereby improving the security of FL in 5G networks.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.01.1900525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9170265","","5G mobile communication;Data models;Training data;Data privacy;Machine learning;Task analysis;Smart contracts;Computer security","","","","","15","","18 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
