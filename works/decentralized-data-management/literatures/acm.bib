abstract = {Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility owing to its ability to enhance the security, reliability, and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas have benefited from research based on this technology, such as finance, remote sensing, data analysis, and healthcare. Data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, and distributed ledgers are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area. Additionally, we summarize the methods used in healthcare per application area and show their pros and cons.},

abstract = {Blockchain offers an innovative approach to storing information, executing transactions, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open environment. Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.},

Extending the technology to the Internet of things (IoT), we can obtain a verifiable and traceable IoT network. Emerging research in IoT applications exploits blockchain technology to record transaction data, optimize current system performance, or construct next-generation systems, which can provide additional security, automatic transaction management, decentralized platforms, offline-to-online data verification, and so on. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey of the key components of IoT blockchain and examine a number of popular blockchain applications.In particular, we first give an architecture overview of popular IoT-blockchain systems by analyzing their network structures and protocols. Then, we discuss variant consensus protocols for IoT blockchains, and make comparisons among different consensus algorithms. Finally, we analyze the traffic model for P2P and blockchain systems and provide several metrics. We also provide a suitable traffic model for IoT-blockchain systems to illustrate network traffic distribution.},

abstract = {Many interesting news and activities are going on in the field of blockchain (sometimes called, Distributed Ledger Technology) related technologies like cryptocurrency, Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI, mostly Deep Learning). Not only developing countries but also developed countries need to be concerned about applying blockchain technology to their e-government system. Blockchain technology has brought a very deep innovation over conventional Client Server Trusted Third Party intermediary system to pure peer-to-peer (P2P) based smart contract system. This smart contract based peer-to-peer system allow participants to share data which was not possible under Client Server Trusted Third Party system due to architectural monopoly nature of Client Server. Smart contract concept brought logical conditions to share data among participants but it does not provide any definition about data value. This peer-to-peer based data sharing can be practically possible only under definition of value on data shared. If this definition is vague, then it will be very difficult to share data among participants. Also if this definition is clear, data sharing participants can get much benefit from this data sharing. This data sharing will be only effective from blockchain based architecture.},

abstract = {Transactive microgrids are emerging as a transformative solution for the problems faced by distribution system operators due to an increase in the use of distributed energy resources and a rapid acceleration in renewable energy generation, such as wind and solar power. Distributed ledgers have recently found widespread interest in this domain due to their ability to provide transactional integrity across decentralized computing nodes. However, the existing state of the art has not focused on the privacy preservation requirement of these energy systems - the transaction level data can provide much greater insights into a prosumer's behavior compared to smart meter data. There are specific safety requirements in transactive microgrids to ensure the stability of the grid and to control the load. To fulfil these requirements, the distribution system operator needs transaction information from the grid, which poses a further challenge to the privacy goals. In this paper, we extend a recently developed trading workflow called PETra and describe our solution for communication and transactional anonymity.},

abstract = {As edge computing applications become increasingly relevant to society, data processing and storage requirements are expected to increase at the 5G networked edge. At the same time, with the emergence of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, one can provide support for trust, immutability, and transparency to share information among networked entities at the edge and in the cloud in 5G networks. A performance model for a permissioned private blockchain platform is developed. Depending on the latency sensitivity and throughput requirements of a 5G edge application, different possibilities are explored to provide support for blockchain technology at the edge. In particular, applications to 5G use-cases are considered, and lazy ledger decoupling between the 5G edge and the 5G cloud is proposed to meet edge latency constraints.},

address = {USA},
abstract = {The pervasiveness of IoT devices makes the delivery mechanism of security updates a challenge. Current IoT systems rely on centralized or brokered paradigms or clouds with huge computational and storage capacities. The existing centralized IoT setups are therefore expensive as the result of factors such as the high costs associated with cloud server and network infrastructures and maintenance. Thus, the need for a fully decentralized peer to peer and secure technology to overcome these problems rises into the realm of existence. Blockchain provides a solution that fulfills the requirements of such a platform. Ideally, the update infrastructure should implement the CIA triad properties (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). In this article, we study how a blockchain application can meet these requirements and propose a novel system to decentrally distribute digital content in a peer-to-peer network using the blockchain technology and smart contracts to overcome the concerns mentioned above. Additionally, in order to prevent the issues stemming from the free-riding challenge in P2P networks (peers refrain to generously share their resources to distribute updates), we exploit a Nash equilibrium micropayment mechanism to grant adequate incentive for peers to participate in distributing IoT update files.},

abstract = {Banks in Europe must comply with new EU regulation and legislation. Recent legislation has focused on personal data, Know Your Customer (KYC), and anti-money laundering. As a result, the cost of KYC compliance is higher than ever, requiring time consuming work by both the banks and their customers in the form of document collection and verification. In this paper we detail a system designed to ease the burden of compliance for banks within the EU and save their customers time through the secure and permissioned sharing of digital KYC data. In order to share data, banks need a secure system capable of protecting the privacy of both them and their clients. We detail a system which uses blockchain technology and various privacy and security enhancing techniques to provide banks with a fast and secure way to share documents required for know your customer compliance. The system was built to be aligned with the GDPR, meaning each participating bank must have explicit permission for a customer to access one or more of their documents. These permissions are stored on a private blockchain shared by the banks. Moreover, we detail methods to anonymise on-chain data where necessary. The use of a private blockchain to achieve consensus on the veracity of customer-granted permissions to data enables participating banks to trust one another as each permission and request is observed, agreed upon, and stored on-chain. To the best of our knowledge we propose the first data sharing system under which there is no outsourcing of data storage. This allows the banks to retain full control of storage security and encryption.},

Considering this, it is natural that data owners have an interest in how their data are being used. In this work, we propose Data aNd Application Tracking (DNAT), a trustworthy platform for tracking the executions of applications over sensitive data in untrusted environments. For traceability purposes, we use blockchain and smart contracts, and to guarantee execution confidentiality and, especially, enforce that operations are appropriately logged in the blockchain, we use Intel SGX. Experiments show that tracking costs on Ethereum varies from 1 to 61 cents of a US dollar, depending on the operation and urgency for consolidation. The time cost of confidential execution is associated with the SGX overhead. It increases non-linearly initially but has a linear growth rate when data and application size gets much higher than the available enclave page cache (â‰ˆ 93 MB).},
