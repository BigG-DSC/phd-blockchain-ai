abstract = {As Learners move from one learning environment to another, there is a key necessity of taking with them a proof of previous learning achievements or experiences. In most cases, this is either expressed in terms of receipt of scores or a certificate of completion. While this may be sufficient for enrollment and other administrative decisions, it poses some limitations to the depth of learning analytics and consequently a slow onboarding process. Also, with different institutions having their learning data isolated from each other, it becomes more difficult to easily access a learner's learning history for all learning activities on other systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based approach for connecting learning data across different Learning Management Systems (LMS), Learning Record Stores (LRS), institutions and organizations. Leveraging on unique properties of blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to ensuring learning data consistency, availability, immutability, security, privacy and access control.},

abstract = {Learning consistent policies in decentralized settings is often problematic. The agents have a myopic view of their neighboring states that could lead to inconsistent action choices. The fundamental question addressed in this work is how to determine and obtain the minimal overlapping context among decentralized decision makers required to make their decisions more consistent. Our approach is a two-phased learning process where agents first learn their policies offline within the context of a simplified environment where it is not necessary to know detailed context information about neighbors. These local policies are then applied in more complex "real" environments where it is expected that agents will encounter a much higher rate of inconsistencies (conflicts) with neighborhood actions. When conflicts are observed, agents switch to "special" states that augment local policy states with additional non-local state information and learn other actions to take in this specific situation. This results in action choices that are less likely to lead to conflicts. We evaluate our approach by addressing meta-level decisions in a complex multiagent weather tracking domain. Experimental results show that our approach achieves good performance on utility and conflict resolution by exploring only a small fraction of the whole search space.},

title = {A Two-Armed Bandit Based Scheme for Accelerated Decentralized Learning},
year = {2011},
isbn = {9783642218262},
publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {The two-armed bandit problem is a classical optimization problem where a decision maker sequentially pulls one of two arms attached to a gambling machine, with each pull resulting in a random reward. The reward distributions are unknown, and thus, one must balance between exploiting existing knowledge about the arms, and obtaining new information. Bandit problems are particularly fascinating because a large class of real world problems, including routing, QoS control, game playing, and resource allocation, can be solved in a decentralized manner when modeled as a system of interacting gambling machines.Although computationally intractable in many cases, Bayesian methods provide a standard for optimal decision making. This paper proposes a novel scheme for decentralized decision making based on the Goore Game in which each decision maker is inherently Bayesian in nature, yet avoids computational intractability by relying simply on updating the hyper parameters of sibling conjugate priors, and on random sampling from these posteriors. We further report theoretical results on the variance of the random rewards experienced by each individual decision maker. Based on these theoretical results, each decision maker is able to accelerate its own learning by taking advantage of the increasingly more reliable feedback that is obtained as exploration gradually turns into exploitation in bandit problem based learning.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the accelerated learning allows us to combine the benefits of conservative learning, which is high accuracy, with the benefits of hurried learning, which is fast convergence. In this manner, our scheme outperforms recently proposed Goore Game solution schemes, where one has to trade off accuracy with speed. We thus believe that our methodology opens avenues for improved performance in a number of applications of bandit based decentralized decision making.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is promising in supporting collaborative learning applications that involve large datasets, massively distributed data owners and unreliable network connectivity. To protect data privacy, existing FL approaches adopt (k,n)-threshold secret sharing schemes, based on the semi-honest assumption for clients, to enable secure multiparty computation in local model update exchange which deals with random client dropouts at the cost of increasing data size. These approaches adopt the semi-honest assumption for clients, therefore they are vulnerable to malicious clients. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving federated learning (BC-based PPFL) framework, which leverages the immutability and decentralized trust properties of blockchain to provide provenance of model updates. Our proof-of-concept implementation of BC-based PPFL demonstrates it is practical for secure aggregation of local model updates in the federated setting.},

We provide definitions, architectures, and applications for the federated-learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject.

However, data owners are reluctant to share their sensitive data to third parties for modelling in many cases. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) has arisen as an alternative to enable collaborative training of models without sharing raw data, by distributing modelling tasks to multiple data owners. Based on FL, we premodel sent a novel and decentralized approach to training encrypted models with privacy-preserved data on Blockchain. In our approach, Blockchain is adopted as the machine learning environment where different actors (i.e., the model provider, the data provider) collaborate on the training task. During the training process, an encryption algorithm is used to protect the privacy of data and the trained model. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is practical in real-world applications.},

With the emergence of new web technologies public developers are able to interface and extend the online websites services as applications. Proposing a fine-grained access control model for controlling application access to the OSN user data does not solve the problem of extension vulnerabilities. Because users might deny all the permissions or deny a subset of the permissions that might render the app non-usable. Moreover, it would be difficult for the app developers to design apps based on these diverse policy preferences. Therefore, it is important for the users to reach a consensus about the privacy settings of the apps they are interested about. My research goal is to design an agent-based approach that harnesses game theory and the dynamical properties of social network to facilitate agent reasoning for achieving optimal privacy conventions in the OSN and to develop decentralized learning mechanisms that facilitate controlled and fast convergence to optimal conventions.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks exploit a lightweight process to identify their users so as to facilitate their fast adoption. However, such convenience comes at the price of making legitimate users subject to different threats created by fake accounts. Therefore, there is a crucial need to empower users with tools helping them in assigning a level of trust to whomever they interact with. To cope with this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel model, DIVa, that leverages on mining techniques to find correlations among user profile attributes. These correlations are discovered not from user population as a whole, but from individual communities, where the correlations are more pronounced. DIVa exploits a decentralized learning approach and ensures privacy preservation as each node in the OSN independently processes its local data and is required to know only its direct neighbors. Extensive experiments using real-world OSN datasets show that DIVa is able to extract fine-grained community-aware correlations among profile attributes with average improvements up to 50% than the global approach.},

abstract = {We study decentralized learning dynamics for the classic assignment game with transferable utility [Shapley and Shubik 1972]. In our model agents follow an aspiration adjustment process based on their experienced payoffs (see [Sauermann and Selten 1962], [Nax and Pradelski 2014]). At random points in time firms and workers match, break up, and re-match in the search for better opportunities. Agents have aspiration levels that they adjust based on their experienced payoffs. When matched an agent occasionally tries to succeed with a higher bid than his current aspiration level. When single an agent lowers his aspiration level in the hope of attracting a partner. In particular agents have no knowledge about other players' payoffs or actions and they update their behavior in a myopic fashion. Behavior fluctuates according to a random variable that reflects current market sentiment: sometimes the firms exhibit greater price stickiness than the workers, and at other times the reverse holds. We show that this stochastic learning process converges in polynomial time to the core. While convergence to the core is known for some types of decentralized dynamics this paper is the first to prove {polynomial time convergence}, a crucial feature from an explanatory and market design standpoint. We also show that without market sentiment the dynamic exhibits exponential time convergence. The proof relies on novel results for random walks on graphs, and more generally suggests a fruitful connection between the theory of random walks and matching theory.},

abstract = {In our recent work, we proposed a systematic cross-layer framework for dynamic multimedia systems, which allows each layer to make autonomous and foresighted decisions that maximize the system's long-term performance, while meeting the application's real-time delay constraints. The proposed solution solved the cross-layer optimization offline, under the assumption that the multimedia system's probabilistic dynamics (e.g. the application's rate-distortion-complexity behavior) were known a priori, by modeling the system as a layered Markov decision process. In practice, however, these dynamics are unknown a priori and therefore must be learned online. In this paper, we address this problem by allowing the multimedia system layers to learn, through repeated interactions with each other, to autonomously optimize the system's long-term performance at run-time. We propose two reinforcement learning algorithms for optimizing the system under different design constraints: the first algorithm solves the cross-layer optimization in a centralized manner, and the second solves it in a decentralized manner. We analyze both algorithms in terms of their required computation, memory, and inter-layer communication overheads. In our experiments, we demonstrate that decentralized learning can perform equally as well as centralized learning, while enabling the layers to act autonomously. Additionally, we show that existing myopic learning algorithms deployed in multimedia systems perform significantly worse than our proposed foresighted learning methods.},

abstract = {In continuous learning settings stochastic stable policies are often necessary to ensure that agents continuously adapt to dynamic environments. The choice of the decentralised learning system and the employed policy plays an important role in the optimisation task. For example, a policy that exhibits fluctuations may also introduce non-linear effects which other agents in the environment may not be able to cope with and even amplify these effects. In dynamic and unpredictable multiagent environments these oscillations may introduce instabilities. In this paper, we take inspiration from the limbic system to introduce an extension to the weighted policy learner, where agents evaluate rewards as either positive or negative feedback, depending on how they deviate from average expected rewards. Agents have positive and negative biases, where a bias either magnifies or depresses a positive or negative feedback signal. To contain the non-linear effects of biased rewards, we incorporate a decaying memory of past positive and negative feedback signals to provide a smoother gradient update on the probability simplex, spreading out the effect of the feedback signal over time. By splitting the feedback signal, more leverage on the win or learn fast (WoLF) principle is possible. The cognitive policy learner is evaluated using a small queueing network and compared with the fair action and weighted policy learner. Emphasis is placed on analysing the dynamics of the learning algorithms with respect to the stability of the queueing network and the overall queueing performance.},

Specifically, for the limitations of each UAV in accessing the global information, we consider a decentralized control strategy and divide the optimization problem into several optimization sub-problems, and then formulated into a UAVs channel capacity game. We analyze such game according to the designed reward function and the potential function. Then, we discuss the existence of the pure Nash equilibrium in the game. To achieve the best Nash equilibrium of the MIMO system, we develop a decentralized learning algorithm, namely decentralized UAVs channel capacity learning. The details of the algorithm is provided and the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed. In the meanwhile, we give some insightful remarks.

Despite its advantages, previous studies have shown that the technology is not completely secure against cyber attacks. Thus, it is crucial to perform domain specific risk analysis to measure how viable the attacks are on the system, their impact and consequently the risk exposure. Specifically, in this paper, we carry out an analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated to an operational multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We conduct an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. The analysis identified five attack goals and five types of attackers that violate the security of the blockchain system. In the case study of the public-permissioned BSMD, we highlight the highest risk factors according to their impact on the victims in terms of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust. Four attack goals represent a risk in terms of economic losses and one attack goal contains many threats that represent a risk that is either unacceptable or undesirable.},

However, these results are very limited in scope, and communication between different neural networks to share knowledge that can lead to the performance of more general tasks is still inadequate. Communication between specialized neural networks is the goal of the present work. We utilize independent sets of neural networks trained for specific tasks, while transferring knowledge among the neural networks allows them to evolve chaining the input and output information. The idea is based on computer network architecture, which is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers. The idea can similarly allow each neural network to specialize in its own task while transferring and receiving information from other neural networks. This can allow different neural networks to be plugged in and knowledge transfer to evolve. It can also allow additional information to be requested, when the task at hand is difficult or hard to resolve.},

abstract = {In a wide range of emerging applications, from disaster management to intelligent sensor networks, teams of software agents can be deployed to effectively solve complex distributed problems. To achieve this, agents typically need to communicate locally sensed information to each other. However, in many settings, there are heavy constraints on the communication infrastructure, making it infeasible for every agent to broadcast all relevant information to everyone else. To address this challenge, we investigate how agents can make good local decisions about what information to send to a set of communication channels with limited bandwidths such that the overall system utility is maximised. Specifically, to solve this problem efficiently in large-scale systems with hundreds or thousands of agents, we develop a novel decentralised algorithm. This combines multi-agent learning techniques with fast decision-theoretic reasoning mechanisms that predict the impact a single agent has on the entire system. We show empirically that our algorithm consistently achieves 85% of a hypothetical centralised optimal strategy with full information, and that it significantly outperforms a number of baseline benchmarks (by up to 600%).},

abstract = {When multiple agents learn in a decentralized manner, the environment appears non-stationary from the perspective of an individual agent due to the exploration and learning of the other agents. Recently proposed deep multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have tried to mitigate this non-stationarity by attempting to determine which samples are from other agent exploration or suboptimality and take them less into account during learning. Based on the same philosophy, this paper introduces a decentralized quantile estimator, which aims to improve performance by distinguishing non-stationary samples based on the likelihood of returns. In particular, each agent considers the likelihood that other agent explorations and policy changes are occurring, essentially utilizing the agent's own estimations to weigh the learning rate that should be applied towards the given samples. We introduce a formal method of calculating differences of our return distribution representations and methods for utilizing it to guide updates. We also explore the effect of risk-seeking strategies for adjusting learning over time and propose adaptive risk distortion functions that guide risk sensitivity. Our experiments, on traditional benchmarks and new domains, show our methods are more stable, sample efficient and more likely to converge to a joint optimal policy than previous methods.},

abstract = {Modern tracking technologies enables new ways for data mining in the wild. It allows wildlife monitoring centers to permanently collect geospatial data in a non-intrusive manner in real-time and at low cost. Unfortunately, wildlife data is exposed to crime and there is already a first reported case of 'cyber-poaching'. Based on stolen geospatial data, poachers can easily track and kill animals. As a result, cautious monitoring centers limited data access for research and public use. This means that the data cannot fully exploit its potential. We propose a novel solution to overcome the security problem. It allows monitoring centers to securely answer questions from the research community and to provide aggregated data to the public while the raw data is protected against unauthorized third parties. This data service can also be monetized. Several new applications are conceivable, such as a mobile app for preventing conflicts between human and wildlife or for engaging people in wildlife donation. Besides presenting the solution and potential use cases, the intention of present article is to start a discussion about the need for data protection and privacy in the animal world.},

abstract = {Collective self-adaptive systems (CSAS) are distributed and interconnected systems composed of multiple agents that can perform complex tasks such as environmental data collection, search and rescue operations, and discovery of natural resources. By providing individual agents with learning capabilities, CSAS can cope with challenges related to distributed sensing and decision-making and operate in uncertain environments. This unique characteristic of CSAS enables the collective to exhibit robust behaviour while achieving system-wide and agent-specific goals. Although learning has been explored in many CSAS applications, selecting suitable learning models and techniques remains a significant challenge that is heavily influenced by expert knowledge. We address this gap by performing a multifaceted analysis of existing CSAS with learning capabilities reported in the literature. Based on this analysis, we introduce a 3D framework that illustrates the learning aspects of CSAS considering the dimensions of autonomy, knowledge access, and behaviour, and facilitates the selection of learning techniques and models. Finally, using example applications from this analysis, we derive open challenges and highlight the need for research on collaborative, resilient and privacy-aware mechanisms for CSAS.},

abstract = {The democratization of Internet of Things and ubiquitous computing equips citizens with phenomenal new ways for online participation and decision-making in application domains of smart grids and smart cities. When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing. The contribution of an I-EPOS open source software suite implemented as a paradigmatic artifact for community aspires to settle a knowledge exchange for the design of new algorithms and application scenarios of sharing economies towards highly participatory and sustainable digital societies.},

The majority of the past efforts has been focusing on a single technology network without dynamic channel states and dynamic channel access. In this talk, we will discuss the potential impact of two new technologies (ie, cognitive radio and coexistence of cross-technology networks) on some fundamental network performance limits.Providing predictable performance and understanding the performance limit have been extremely challenging because of the uncontrollable and hard-to-predict external disturbances and opportunities. In the first part of the talk, we will summarize recent results on designing zero-regret online channel access schemes for multihop wireless networks based on recent development of multi-armed bandits problem. Recently several novel solutions were proposed for cross-technology coexistence without intervening legacy systems. In the second part of the talk, we will summarize recent efforts on designing co-prosperity wireless networks. We mainly focus on protecting the low-power Zigbee networks from the nearby WiFi networks. Then based on the new paradigms of cognitive radio networks and cross-technology coexistence, we give a first try to mathematically model the multihop cognitive radio networks with online spectrum access, and model the coexistability of two networks. We propose to further investigate the network capacity under these two new paradigms.},

abstract = {Research in cooperative games often assumes that agents know the coalitional values with certainty, and that they can belong to one coalition only. By contrast, this work assumes that the value of a coalition is based on an underlying collaboration structure emerging due to existing but unknown relations among the agents; and that agents can form overlapping coalitions . Specifically, we first propose Relational Rules , a novel representation scheme for cooperative games with overlapping coalitions, which encodes the aforementioned relations, and which extends the well-known MC-nets representation to this setting. We then present a novel decision-making method for decentralized overlapping coalition formation, which exploits probabilistic topic modeling ---and, in particular, online Latent Dirichlet Allocation . By interpreting formed coalitions as documents, agents can effectively learn topics that correspond to profitable collaboration structures.},

abstract = {Modern distributed systems are exposed to constant changes in their operating environment, leading to high uncertainty. Self-adaptive and self-organising approaches have become a popular solution for runtime reactivity to this uncertainty. However, these approaches use predefined, expertly-crafted policies or models, constructed at design-time, to guide system (re)configuration. They are human-centric, making modelling or policy-writing difficult to scale to increasingly complex systems; and are inflexible in their ability to deal with the unexpected at runtime (e.g. conditions not captured in a policy). We argue for a machine-centric approach to this problem, in which the desired behaviour is autonomously learned and emerges at runtime from a large pool of small alternative components, as a continuous reaction to the observed behaviour of the software and the characteristics of its operating environment. We demonstrate our principles in the context of data-centre software, showing that our approach is able to autonomously coordinate a distributed infrastructure composed of emergent web servers and a load balancer. Our initial results validate our approach, showing autonomous convergence on an optimal configuration, and also highlight the open challenges in providing fully machine-led distributed emergent software systems.},

Unfortunately the process of sharing learning data today is not always transparent to students. Our aim is to improve the transparency and user control aspects of sharing data whilst maintaining the educational utility of data sharing between tutors and students. To do so, we start by surveying the possible methods of sharing data, and we use this to design a token-based scheme for facilitating data sharing. We implemented our scheme and observed it in use by 7,798 students over the course of one year. We find that our proposed scheme provides a good balance between transparency, user control, educational utility and scalability.},

abstract = {Human mobility prediction is essential to a variety of human-centered computing applications achieved through upgrading of location-based services (LBS) to future-location-based services (FLBS). Previous studies on human mobility prediction have mainly focused on centralized human mobility prediction, where user mobility data are collected, trained and predicted at the cloud server side. However, such a centralized approach leads to a high risk of privacy issues, and a real-time centralized system for processing such a large volume of distributed data is extremely difficult to apply. Moreover, a large and dynamic set of users makes the predictive model extremely challenging to personalize. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized attention-based human mobility predictor in which 1) no additional training procedure is required for personalized prediction, 2) no additional training procedure is required for incremental learning, and 3) the predictor can be trained and predicted in a decentralized way. We tested our method on big data of real-world mobile phone user GPS and on Android devices, and achieved a low-power consumption and a good prediction accuracy without collecting user data in the server or applying additional training on the user side.},

We consider distributed multi-party ML proposals and identify their shortcomings. We then propose brokered learning, which distinguishes the curator (who determines the training set-up) from that of the broker coordinator (who runs the training process).

Higher education institutions have started to adopt the use of technology into their traditional teaching mechanisms for enhancing learning and teaching. In this paper, two datasets have been considered for the prediction and classification of student performance respectively using five machine learning algorithms.

When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard.

abstract = {Today's herd management undergoes a major transformation triggered by the penetration of cheap sensor solutions into cattle farms, and the promise of predictive analytics to detect animal health issues and product-related problems before they occur. The latter is particularly important to prevent disease spread, ensure animal health, animal welfare and product quality. Sensor businesses entering the market tend to build their solutions as end-to-end pipelines spanning sensors, proprietary algorithms, cloud services, and mobile apps. Since data privacy is an important issue in this industry, as a result, disconnected data silos, heterogeneity of APIs, and lack of common standards limit the value the sensor technologies could provide for herd management. In the last few years, researchers and communities proposed a number of data integration architectures to enable exchange between streams of sensor data. This paper surveys the existing efforts and outlines the opportunities they fail to address by treating sensor data as a black box. We discuss alternative solutions to the problem based on privacy-preserving collaborative learning, and provide a set of scenarios to show their benefits for both farmers and businesses.},

abstract = {How to optimally dispatch orders to vehicles and how to trade off between immediate and future returns are fundamental questions for a typical ride-hailing platform. We model ride-hailing as a large-scale parallel ranking problem and study the joint decision-making task of order dispatching and fleet management in online ride-hailing platforms. This task brings unique challenges in the following four aspects. First, to facilitate a huge number of vehicles to act and learn efficiently and robustly, we treat each region cell as an agent and build a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Second, to coordinate the agents from different regions to achieve long-term benefits, we leverage the geographical hierarchy of the region grids to perform hierarchical reinforcement learning. Third, to deal with the heterogeneous and variant action space for joint order dispatching and fleet management, we design the action as the ranking weight vector to rank and select the specific order or the fleet management destination in a unified formulation. Fourth, to achieve the multi-scale ride-hailing platform, we conduct the decision-making process in a hierarchical way where a multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to incorporate the impacts of neighbor agents and capture the key agent in each scale. The whole novel framework is named as CoRide. Extensive experiments based on multiple cities real-world data as well as analytic synthetic data demonstrate that CoRide provides superior performance in terms of platform revenue and user experience in the task of city-wide hybrid order dispatching and fleet management over strong baselines.},

abstract = {Blockchain networks have enjoyed remarkable attention the past few years in both the research community and the society at large. Such networks carry the promise of highly decentralized validation and witnessing of important social and economic events, reducing the need to rely on centralized authorities. Public proof-of-work based networks specifically, despite their limitations and challenges, continue to be popular due to their simplicity and intuitiveness. However, for such networks to perpetually meet viability, efficiency, security and environmental sustainability objectives, they need to adapt to environmental changes via continuous reconfiguration of their operating parameters. In this paper, we attempt to formulate this blockchain network adaptability problem as one of control engineering. We sketch the basic characteristics of blockchain networks as systems and identify variables available for designing a controller that allows such networks to attain macroscopic operating objectives. By means of describing and simulating a simple idealized proportional controller, we demonstrate the benefits and some of the challenges in designing such controllers.},

We show that a recurrent neural network (RNN) can learn a communication protocol for coordination, even if the actions to coordinate lie outside of the communication range. We also show that a single RNN is unable to do this if there is an independent action sequence necessary before the coordinated action can be executed. We propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning model for multi-agent systems that separates the communication and coordination task from the action picking through a hierarchical policy. As a testbed, we propose the Dungeon Lever Game and we extend the Differentiable Inter-Agent Learning (DIAL) framework [3]. First we prove that the agents need a hierarchical policy to learn communication and actions and, second, we present results from our successful model of the Dungeon Lever Game.},

In this paper we analyze the nature of community formation since communication in such networks is highly dependent on the socializing behavior of humans. Using real world mobility traces we propose an online algorithm for the nodes to detect their community members based on the mobility parameters contact time (CT) and inter-contact time (ICT). We also derive an estimator for power-law index since CT and ICT follow power-law distribution. Based on the obtained information we propose a social based routing algorithm, named Community Aware Two-Hop routing, and compare it with generic Epidemic and Prophet routing and Bubble-Rap, a social based routing. Results show that the proposed routing protocol performs better than Bubble-Rap and achieve similar performance with respect to Epidemic and Prophet, but at a much lower cost.},

abstract = {Large-scale simulation studies are necessary to study the learning behaviour of individual agents and the overall system dynamics. One reason is that planning algorithms to find optimal solutions to fully observable general decentralised Markov decision problems do not admit to polynomial-time worst-case complexity bounds. Additionally, agent interaction often implies a non-stationary environment which does not lend itself to asymptotically greedy policies. Therefore, policies with a constant level of exploration are required to be able to adapt continuously. This paper casts the application domain of distributed task assignment into the formalisms of queueing theory, complex networks and decentralised Markov decision problems to analyse the impact of the momentum of a standard back-propagation neural network function approximator and the discount factor of $SARSA(0)$ reinforcement learning and the $epsilon$ parameter of the $epsilon$-greedy policy. For this purpose large queueing networks of one thousand interacting agents are evolved. A Kriging metamodel is fitted and in combination with simulated annealing optimal operating conditions with respect to the total average response time are found. The insights gained from this study are significant in that they provide guidance in deploying large-scale distributed task assignment systems modelled as multi-agent queueing networks.},

We begin by describing a method that learns a shaped reward function given a set of state and temporal abstractions. Next, we consider decomposition of the per-timestep reward in multieffector problems, in which the overall agent can be decomposed into multiple units that are concurrently carrying out various tasks. We show by example that to find a good reward decomposition, it is often necessary to first shape the rewards appropriately. We then give a function approximation algorithm for solving both problems together. Standard reinforcement learning algorithms can be augmented with our methods, and we show experimentally that in each case, significantly faster learning results.},

Hence, there is a growing need to develop algorithmic approaches that can learn to recognize commonalities in opponent strategies and exploit such commonalities to improve strategic response. Recently a framework [9] has been proposed that aims for targeted optimality against a set of finite memory opponents. We propose an approach that aims for targeted optimality against the set of all possible multiagent learning algorithms that perform gradient search to select a single stage Nash Equilibria of a repeated game. Such opponents induce a Markov Decision Process as the learning environment and appropriate responses to such environments are learned by assuming a generative model of the environment. In the absence of a generative model, we present a framework, MB-AIM-FSI, that models the opponent online based on interactions, solves the model off-line when sufficient information has been gathered, stores the strategy in the repository and finally uses it judiciously when playing against the same or similar opponent at a later time.},

Learning in such a situation is challenging due to vehicular mobility, which renders a continuously changing environment for each learning vehicle. Without no explicit coordination mechanisms, inefficient behaviors among vehicles might cause fatal uncoordinated outcomes. To solve this issue, we propose two basic coordination models to enable distributed learning of cooperative overtaking maneuvers in a group of vehicles. Extension mechanisms are then presented to make these models workable in more complex and realistic settings with any number of vehicles. Experiments verify that, by capturing the underlying consistency of identities or positions during vehicles' movement, efficient coordinated behaviors can be achieved simply through vehicles' local learning interactions.},

abstract = {Mate selection is a key step in evolutionary algorithms which traditionally has been panmictic and based solely on fitness. Various mate selection techniques have been published which show improved performance due to the introduction of mate restrictions or the use of genotypic/phenotypic features. Those techniques typically suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) they are fixed for the entire evolutionary run, which is suboptimal because problem specific mate selection may be expected to outperform general purpose mate selection and because the best mate selection configuration may be dependent on the state of the evolutionary run, and (2) they require problem specific tuning in order to obtain good performance, which often is a time consuming manual process. This paper introduces two versions of Learning Individual Mating Preferences (LIMP), a novel mate selection technique in which characteristics of good mates are learned during the evolutionary process. Centralized LIMP (C-LIMP) learns at the population level, while Decentralized LIMP (D-LIMP) learns at the individual level. Results are presented showing D-LIMP to outperform a traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), the Variable Dissortative Mating Genetic Algorithm (VDMGA), and C-LIMP on the DTRAP and MAXSAT benchmark problems, while both LIMP techniques perform comparably to VDMGA on NK Landscapes.},

The aim is to learn to use expert coordination knowledge to restrict the joint action space and to direct exploration towards more promising states, thereby improving the overall learning rate. We model such coordination knowledge as constraints and propose a two-level RL system that utilizes these constraints for online applications. Our declarative approach towards specifying coordination in multi-agent learning allows knowledge sharing between constraints and features (basis functions) for function approximation. Results on a soccer game and a tactical real-time strategy game show that coordination constraints improve the learning rate compared to using only unary constraints. The two-level RL system also outperforms existing single-level approach that utilizes joint action selection via coordination graphs.},

abstract = {Much of the success of single agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in recent years can be attributed to the use of experience replay memories (ERM), which allow Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) to be trained efficiently through sampling stored state transitions. However, care is required when using ERMs for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL), as stored transitions can become outdated when agents update their policies in parallel citefoerster2017stabilising. In this work we apply leniency citepanait2006lenient to MA-DRL. Lenient agents map state-action pairs to decaying temperature values that control the amount of leniency applied towards negative policy updates that are sampled from the ERM. This introduces optimism in the value-function update, and has been shown to facilitate cooperation in tabular fully-cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. We evaluate our Lenient-DQN (LDQN) empirically against the related Hysteretic-DQN (HDQN) algorithm citeomidshafiei2017deep as well as a modified version we call scheduled -HDQN, that uses average reward learning near terminal states. Evaluations take place in extended variations of the Coordinated Multi-Agent Object Transportation Problem (CMOTP) citebucsoniu2010multi. We find that LDQN agents are more likely to converge to the optimal policy in a stochastic reward CMOTP compared to standard and scheduled-HDQN agents.},

Nonetheless, we show that the parallel MAC game admits a unique equilibrium almost surely, thus establishing an important class of counterexamples where these sufficient conditions are not necessary. Furthermore, if the network's users employ a distributed learning scheme based on the replicator dynamics, we show that they converge to equilibrium from almost any initial condition, even though users only have local information at their disposal.},

abstract = {The emergence of Blockchain has attracted widespread attention. However, we observe that in practice, many applications on permissioned blockchains do not benefit from the decentralized architecture. When decentralized architecture is used but not required, system performance is often restricted, resulting in low throughput, high latency, and significant storage overhead. Hence, we propose LedgerDB on Alibaba Cloud, which is a centralized ledger database with tamper-evidence and non-repudiation features similar to blockchain, and provides strong auditability. LedgerDB has much higher throughput compared to blockchains. It offers stronger auditability by adopting a TSA two-way peg protocol, which prevents malicious behaviors from both users and service providers. LedgerDB supports verifiable data removals demanded by many real-world applications, which are able to remove obsolete records for storage saving and hide records for regulatory purpose, without compromising its verifiability. Experimental evaluation shows that LedgerDB's throughput is 80X higher than state-of-the-art permissioned blockchain (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric). Many blockchain customers (e.g., IP protection and supply chain) on Alibaba Cloud have switched to LedgerDB for its high throughput, low latency, strong auditability, and ease of use.},

abstract = {Solving complex but structured problems in a decentralized manner via multiagent collaboration has received much attention in recent years. This is natural, as on one hand, multiagent systems usually possess a structure that determines the allowable interactions among the agents; and on the other hand, the single most pressing need in a cooperative multiagent system is to coordinate the local policies of autonomous agents with restricted capabilities to serve a system-wide goal. The presence of uncertainty makes this even more challenging, as the agents face the additional need to learn the unknown environment parameters while forming (and following) local policies in an online fashion. In this paper, we provide the first Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) approach for distributed coordination and learning in a cooperative multiagent system by devising two solutions to this type of problem. More specifically, we show how the Value of Perfect Information (VPI) can be used to perform efficient decentralised exploration in both model-based and model-free BRL, and in the latter case, provide a closed form solution for VPI, correcting a decade old result by Dearden, Friedman and Russell. To evaluate these solutions, we present experimental results comparing their relative merits, and demonstrate empirically that both solutions outperform an existing multiagent learning method, representative of the state-of-the-art.},

However, both the training and inference tasks are typically performed in the provider's cloud, leading to multiple privacy issues to the data subject. Current privacy-preserving concepts are neither practicable for AI algorithms nor promise mutual benefits for both parties. To address these issues, we propose {P}Net---a novel two-level approach for privacy-preserving personalization, which exploits 'divisible' AI algorithms and anonymous inter-person similarity measurements. In short, {P}Net splits the training task into a cloud-based general model learning process and 'local' personalization steps in which the general 'black-box' model is subsequently adapted to individuals (level 1). Based on anonymously-contributed model modifications (patches) resulting from the first level, {P}Net further allows new users to request a community model---representing the general model personalized by crowd-sourced patches from other similar users (level 2). Our experiments show that {P}Net outperforms existing techniques especially when only a few user data is labeled. With {P}Net, new users can now directly benefit from personalized applications in a practical and privacy-preserving way with reduced labeling effort.},

abstract = {Federated learning has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative and privacy-preserving learning. Participants in a federated learning process cooperatively train a model by exchanging model parameters instead of the actual training data, which they might want to keep private. However, parameter interaction and the resulting model still might disclose information about the training data used. To address these privacy concerns, several approaches have been proposed based on differential privacy and secure multiparty computation (SMC), among others. They often result in large communication overhead and slow training time. In this paper, we propose HybridAlpha, an approach for privacy-preserving federated learning employing an SMC protocol based on functional encryption. This protocol is simple, efficient and resilient to participants dropping out. We evaluate our approach regarding the training time and data volume exchanged using a federated learning process to train a CNN on the MNIST data set. Evaluation against existing crypto-based SMC solutions shows that HybridAlpha can reduce the training time by 68% and data transfer volume by 92% on average while providing the same model performance and privacy guarantees as the existing solutions.},

abstract = {In wireless access network optimization, today's main challenges reside in traffic offload and in the improvement of both capacity and coverage networks. The mobile operators are interested in solving their localized coverage and capacity problems in areas where the macro network signal is not able to serve the demand for mobile data. Thus, the major issue for mobile operators is to find the best solution at reasonable expanses. The femto cell seems to be the answer to this problematic. In this work, we focus on the problem of sharing femto access between a same mobile operator's customers. A paradigm for bandwidth sharing management added to a TBAS model for exchanging connectivity is proposed for a fair sharing connectivity system ensuring QoS. This paper focuses on an economic model based on FON model and considers the sharing femto access problem as a problem divided into to 2 levels: a game restricted to service requesters customers (SRCs) and a second game restricted to service providers customers (SPCs). We consider that SRCs are static and have some similar and regular connection behavior. We also note that each SPC and each SRC have a software embedded respectively on its femto access, user equipment (UE) on which ADist algorithm is running to learn the best strategy increasing its gain using only local information.We will try to answer the following questions for a game with N SRCs and P SPCs: how many connections are necessary for each SRC/SPC in order to learn the strategy maximizing its gain? Does exist an algorithm converging to a stable state? If yes, does this state a Nash Equilibrium?},

We present an Unsupervised Behavior Learning (UBL) system for IaaS cloud computing infrastructures. UBL leverages Self-Organizing Maps to capture emergent system behaviors and predict unknown anomalies. For scalability, UBL uses residual resources in the cloud infrastructure for behavior learning and anomaly prediction with little add-on cost. We have implemented a prototype of the UBL system on top of the Xen platform and conducted extensive experiments using a range of distributed systems. Our results show that UBL can predict performance anomalies with high accuracy and achieve sufficient lead time for automatic anomaly prevention. UBL supports large-scale infrastructure-wide behavior learning with negligible overhead.},

abstract = {This article describes Distributed W-Learning (DWL), a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for collaborative agent-based optimization of pervasive systems. DWL supports optimization towards multiple heterogeneous policies and addresses the challenges arising from the heterogeneity of the agents that are charged with implementing them. DWL learns and exploits the dependencies between agents and between policies to improve overall system performance. Instead of always executing the locally-best action, agents learn how their actions affect their immediate neighbors and execute actions suggested by neighboring agents if their importance exceeds the local action's importance when scaled using a predefined or learned collaboration coefficient. We have evaluated DWL in a simulation of an Urban Traffic Control (UTC) system, a canonical example of the large-scale pervasive systems that we are addressing. We show that DWL outperforms widely deployed fixed-time and simple adaptive UTC controllers under a variety of traffic loads and patterns. Our results also confirm that enabling collaboration between agents is beneficial as is the ability for agents to learn the degree to which it is appropriate for them to collaborate. These results suggest that DWL is a suitable basis for optimization in other large-scale systems with similar characteristics.},

abstract = {This paper provides new insights on the convergence of a locally connected network of pulse coupled oscillator PCOs i.e., a bioinspired model for communication networks to synchronous and desynchronous states, and their implication in terms of the decentralized synchronization and scheduling in communication networks. Bioinspired techniques have been advocated by many as fault-tolerant and scalable alternatives to produce self-organization in communication networks. The PCO dynamics, in particular, have been the source of inspiration for many network synchronization and scheduling protocols. However, their convergence properties, especially in locally connected networks, have not been fully understood, prohibiting the migration into mainstream standards. This paper provides further results on the convergence of PCOs in locally connected networks and the achievable convergence accuracy under propagation delays. For synchronization, almost sure convergence is proved for three nodes and accuracy results are obtained for general locally connected networks, whereas for scheduling or desynchronization, results are derived for locally connected networks with mild conditions on the overlapping set of maximal cliques. These issues have not been fully addressed before in the literature.},

This paper details an extended formal model for cooperative coevolutionary algorithms, and uses it to explore possible reasons these algorithms converge to optimal or suboptimal solutions. We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, this theoretical model will converge to the globally optimal solution. The proofs provide the underlying theoretical foundation for a better application of cooperative coevolutionary algorithms.

abstract = {We consider unreliable distributed learning systems wherein the training data is kept confidential by external workers, and the learner has to interact closely with those workers to train a model. In particular, we assume that there exists a system adversary that can adaptively compromise some workers; the compromised workers deviate from their local designed specifications by sending out arbitrarily malicious messages. We assume in each communication round, up to q out of the m workers suffer Byzantine faults. Each worker keeps a local sample of size n and the total sample size is N=nm. We propose a secured variant of the gradient descent method that can tolerate up to a constant fraction of Byzantine workers, i.e., q/m = O(1). Moreover, we show the statistical estimation error of the iterates converges in O(log N) rounds to O(√/N + √/N ), where d is the model dimension. As long as q=O(d), our proposed algorithm achieves the optimal error rate O(√/N $. Our results are obtained under some technical assumptions. Specifically, we assume strongly-convex population risk. Nevertheless, the empirical risk (sample version) is allowed to be non-convex. The core of our method is to robustly aggregate the gradients computed by the workers based on the filtering procedure proposed by Steinhardt et al. On the technical front, deviating from the existing literature on robustly estimating a finite-dimensional mean vector, we establish a uniform concentration of the sample covariance matrix of gradients, and show that the aggregated gradient, as a function of model parameter, converges uniformly to the true gradient function. To get a near-optimal uniform concentration bound, we develop a new matrix concentration inequality, which might be of independent interest.},

abstract = { Seventeen years after its initial publication at ICSE 2000, the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style continues to hold significance as both a guide for understanding how the World Wide Web is designed to work and an example of how principled design, through the application of architectural styles, can impact the development and understanding of large-scale software architecture. However, REST has also become an industry buzzword: frequently abused to suit a particular argument, confused with the general notion of using HTTP, and denigrated for not being more like a programming methodology or implementation framework.  In this paper, we chart the history, evolution, and shortcomings of REST, as well as several related architectural styles that it inspired, from the perspective of a chain of doctoral dissertations produced by the University of California's Institute for Software Research at UC Irvine. These successive theses share a common theme: extending the insights of REST to new domains and, in their own way, exploring the boundary of software engineering as it applies to decentralized software architectures and architectural design. We conclude with discussion of the circumstances, environment, and organizational characteristics that gave rise to this body of work. },

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rapid proliferation of personalized mobile Apps, which poses a pressing need for user experience improvement. A promising solution is to model App usage by learning semantic-aware App usage representations which can capture the relation among time, locations and Apps. However, it is non-trivial due to the complexity, dynamics, and heterogeneity characteristics of App usage. To smooth over these obstacles and achieve the goal, we propose SA-GCN, a novel representation learning model to map Apps, location, and time units into dense embedding vectors considering spatio-temporal characteristics and unit properties simultaneously. To handle complexity and dynamics, we build an App usage graph by regarding App, time, and location units as nodes and their co-occurrence relations as edges. For heterogeneity, we develop a Graph Convolutional Network with meta path-based objective function to combine the structure of the graph and the attribute of units into the semantic-aware representations. We evaluate the performance of SA-GCN via a large-scale real-world dataset. In-depth analysis shows that SA-GCN characterizes the complex relationships among different units and recover meaningful spatio-temporal patterns. Moreover, we make use of the learned representations in App usage prediction task without post-training and achieve 8.3% of the performance gain compared with state-of-the-art baselines.},
